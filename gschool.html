    <h2>Why Now?</h2>
    <p>I'm ready to shore up my skills to be a better asset to any company I decide to work for. I'm tired of waiting on IT individuals to help me do my job. As an employee  for a very small company, we relied heavily on open source software that we had to customize in house. As the first marketing professional hired at said company, I found that there was no infrastructure in place to execute and track any marketing activities. Nor did the engineers and IT personnel have the resources to customize the existing tools or integrate new tools to help me. I felt just like I was going round and round in circles, ending back up where I started, none the better and having wasted my time, just like my friend here on the left.</p></div>

  <h2>Why Galvanize?</h2>
  <p>I've tried a few MOOCs and have learnt a lot, but my personal deadlines were rarely met, what with all the other responsibilities that come with being an employee, a wife, and a mom. It's hard to get yourself motivated to spend time learning after a long day of other chores and tasks. What interested me most about GSchool was the curriculum and its philosophy that it was more important to learn how to teach yourself something so that you could always effectively learn what was necessary. I have also always been a practical learner, implementing what I learn as many times and ways as possible to cement the knowledge in my head.</p></div>

    <h2>What Next?</h2>
    <p>I'd like to go back into marketing and be a "Growth Hacker" or a "Developer Evangelist" where I will be able to use my new found skills to the greatest extent. I love working for smaller companies where I work closely with many other employees and where my contribution is felt.</p>

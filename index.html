    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Uthra Krishnan. I am a marketing professional with experience in content management, demand generation, social media marketing, and product management. I graduated from San Jose State University with a degree in business administration after having switched my major and the university I was attending 6 times (talk about taking the long road). I love a good laugh and to lose myself in another world, be it in a book, a song, or a movie.</p>

  <h5>TREE HOUSE</h5>
  <p>"A tree house, a free house,<br>A secret you and me house,<br>A high up in the leafy branches<br>Cozy as can be house.</p>
  <p>A street house, a neat house,<br>Be sure to wipe your feet house<br>Is not my kind of house at all--<br>Let's go live in a tree house."</p>

    <h2> Home Sweet Home</h2>
    <p>
      Home sweet home is in Fremont, California where I live with my husband, our two sons, and my in-laws, all in one house. I would love a pet but my sons do a good job of filling in the position, especially my oldest who is a monkey incarnated. I have a younger sister who lives in NYC (whom we are trying to convince to move out here) and my parents are not too far away in Clovis, CA. My husband's brother lives over in Pleasanton with his family. We have various cousins and close family friends that we grew up with in the area as well. Family is everything to us and we firmly believe that it takes a village. And so we bought a house to hold us all and furnished it with a couch on steroids that seats 12 comfortably with lots of extra floor cushions just in case.

    <h5>PUT SOMETHING IN</h5>
    <p>"Draw a crazy picture,<br>Write a nutty poem,<br>Sing a mumble-gumble song,<br>Whistle through your comb.<br>Do a loony-goony dance<br>'Cross the kitchen floor,<br>Put something silly in the world<br>That ain't been there before.”</p>
